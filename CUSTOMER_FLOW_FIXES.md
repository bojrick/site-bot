# Customer Flow Fixes & Email Integration

## Issues Fixed ‚úÖ

### 1. Flow Getting Stuck Issue
**Problem**: Users were getting stuck in the `post_inquiry` state when they didn't provide expected responses after completing the inquiry.

**Solution**: 
- Added proper session clearing when users provide unexpected responses
- Added helpful guidance messages to redirect users back to the main flow
- Improved response matching to handle more variations of user input

### 2. Interactive Element Handling

**Solution**:
- Added proper handling for `interactiveData` in booking flow
- Now correctly processes both list selections and text input
- Better validation for date/time selections

### 3. Error Handling & Logging
**Problem**: Lack of proper error handling and debugging information.

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive error handling for all database operations
- Added detailed logging throughout the flow for better debugging
- Graceful fallbacks when operations fail

### 4. Session Data Management
**Problem**: Customer name and other data wasn't being carried forward between flow steps.

**Solution**:
- Improved session data storage and retrieval
- Customer name now carries from inquiry to booking
- Better data persistence throughout the flow

## Email Integration üìß

### Features Added
- **Automatic Email Notifications**: When a customer completes an inquiry, an email is automatically sent to `info@reevaempire.com`
- **Rich HTML Emails**: Professional-looking emails with customer details formatted in a table
- **Fallback Logging**: If email fails, customer details are logged for manual processing
- **Non-blocking**: Email failures don't interrupt the customer flow

### Email Content Includes
- Customer name, phone, and email
- Occupation and space requirements
- Intended use and budget range
- Timestamp and source information

## Setup Instructions üîß

### 1. Add Environment Variables
Add these to your environment (`.env` file or hosting platform):

```bash
# Zoho OAuth Credentials (you already have these)
ZOHO_CLIENT_ID=1000.6R5MW71WBIV5YQW19775D7R6789PYD
ZOHO_CLIENT_SECRET=1a1e87881e91ef5cb0ecb0590bca20b77d28b805cb

# These need to be obtained through OAuth flow
ZOHO_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token_here
ZOHO_FROM_EMAIL=your-email@domain.com
```

### 2. Complete Zoho OAuth Setup
Run the setup script to get your refresh token:

```bash
npm run setup-zoho
```

Follow the instructions to:
1. Open the provided authorization URL
2. Login to Zoho and authorize the app
3. Copy the authorization code from the redirect URL
4. Run the exchange command with your code

### 3. Test Email Functionality
Once configured, the setup script will test the email service automatically.

## Flow Improvements üîÑ

### Better Response Handling
The bot now accepts more variations of user responses:
- **For booking**: "book", "yes", "1", "book site visit"
- **For later contact**: "later", "call me", "2"
- **For starting over**: Any unexpected response now guides user back to main menu

### Improved User Experience
- Clear error messages for invalid inputs
- Better guidance when users are confused
- Automatic session clearing to prevent stuck states
- Consistent flow progression

### Enhanced Logging
All major actions are now logged with:
- Session state changes
- Database operations
- Email sending attempts
- Error conditions

## Troubleshooting üîç

### If Email Isn't Working
1. Check that all environment variables are set
2. Verify your Zoho credentials are correct
3. Ensure you have the necessary Zoho Mail permissions
4. Check the logs for detailed error messages
5. Customer details will still be logged even if email fails

### If Flow Gets Stuck
1. Check the console logs for session state
2. Verify database connectivity
3. The improved flow should now auto-recover from most stuck states
4. Users can always type "start" or "menu" to reset

### Common Issues
- **Invalid email format**: Better validation messages
- **Date/time selection**: Improved handling of interactive elements  
- **Unexpected responses**: Automatic guidance back to main flow

## Testing the Flow üß™

### Test Scenarios
1. **Complete Flow**: Go through entire inquiry ‚Üí booking process
2. **Error Recovery**: Send unexpected responses to test recovery
3. **Interactive Elements**: Test date/time selection lists
4. **Email Notifications**: Complete an inquiry to test email sending

### Manual Testing Commands
```bash
# Test email service
npm run setup-zoho

# View logs during testing
tail -f server.log
```

The customer flow is now more robust, user-friendly, and includes automatic email notifications to keep your team informed of new inquiries!
